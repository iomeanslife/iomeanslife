### Non-conventional software engineering with a dash of grit and freedom ðŸŒµ

- Thank you for visiting my github profile. I store the public and private repositories of my personal projects here.
- Currently working on my app called Habit Cards, which I have already released on the App Store ðŸ“±
- Right now I am learning Swift and Flutter, which I use for the iOS version, the website, and potentially the Android version.
- I am open to new opportunities, so feel free to reach out to me âœ¨
- If any of the projects interest you, feel free to write to me about them.
